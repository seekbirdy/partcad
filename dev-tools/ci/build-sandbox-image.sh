# Build one of PartCAD's Python sandbox base images.

#     PC_IMAGE_REF=ghcr.io/partcad/partcad-container-python:0.8.70-py3.11-amd64 \
#     PC_PYTHON_VERSION=3.11 PC_PARTCAD_VERSION=0.8.70 \
#     dev-tools/ci/build-sandbox-image.sh
#
# There is one of these images per supported interpreter per architecture, and
# until this file existed there were two places that knew how to build one:
# "Build the Python sandbox images" in '.github/workflows/test.yml', which
# builds the matrix and publishes it, and '.github/actions/sandbox-image',
# which built a copy in every job that renders. The same Dockerfile with the
# same two build arguments, written out twice, with nothing keeping them in
# step -- and the way that goes wrong is not a failure but a *disagreement*: a
# job testing an image built differently from the one the run published, under
# a name that says they are the same.
#
# So both call this, and there is one answer to "how is this image built".
#
# Everything is read from the environment rather than taken as arguments,
# because every caller is a CI step that already has these as environment
# variables and because a positional list of five is a list somebody will get
# out of order:
#
#   PC_IMAGE_REF        required. The full '<name>:<tag>' to build. The caller
#                       owns the tag -- see '.github/actions/container-images'
#                       for which tag a run addresses -- because the tag is the
#                       one thing about these images that is not a property of
#                       the Dockerfile.
#   PC_PYTHON_VERSION   required. The interpreter the image carries.
#   PC_PARTCAD_VERSION  required. The release installed *into* it. Not the same
#                       thing as the tag, and deliberately so: an image built
#                       from a branch to test this commit's Dockerfile still
#                       installs the release.
#   PC_PLATFORM         optional. 'linux/amd64', 'linux/arm64'. Defaults to the
#                       builder's own, which is what a job wanting an image it
#                       can run locally wants.
#   PC_PUSH             optional, 'true' or 'false' (default). Pushing and
#                       loading are exclusive in buildx: a pushed image is not
#                       in the local daemon and a loaded one is not in the
#                       registry, so the caller says which it is after.
#   PC_CACHE_FROM       optional. A registry ref to take layers from. Left
#                       empty by a caller that has nothing to point at -- the
#                       first build of a tag, most of all.
