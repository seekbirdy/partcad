"""
The bootstrap extension: the welcome window, and the package the IDE starts in.

Everything here is a link between two files that nothing else keeps together --
a walkthrough addressed by a string in JavaScript, a button that runs a command
another extension contributes, a starter package whose path the installer tests
and the documentation both spell out. Each of them breaks into an IDE that
starts and looks right, with a welcome window whose buttons do nothing.
