"""The three images that are checked in rather than rendered by the build.

`make_icons.py` cannot run on Windows -- `cairocffi` finds no `libcairo` there --
so `resources/partcad-ide.ico` and the two wizard bitmaps beside it are in git,
and the Windows build takes them from there. A file in git is a file that can
rot, and the ways they rot silently are worth catching here: an `.ico` that no
longer holds the sizes the generator declares, one that a bad checkout or a
text-mode transfer has truncated, and a bitmap that is no longer the size Inno
Setup draws or is no longer named by the installer script.

What this cannot check is whether any of them still looks like the current logo.
That needs the renderers, which is the whole reason the files are checked in;
README.md says to regenerate them whenever the logo changes.
