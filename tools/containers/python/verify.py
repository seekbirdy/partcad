"""Whether this image keeps the base image contract.

Run at build time, and kept in the image afterwards so that an image built
`FROM` this one can run it too -- which is the point. A plugin author adds an
apt package, moves the interpreter, drops the RPC service or switches the
working directory, and finds out here rather than from a user whose analysis
fails inside a sandbox with a message about none of it.

    docker run --rm ghcr.io/you/your-image python3 /pc/verify.py

Every check states what breaks when it fails, because a conformance check that
only says "assertion failed" leaves the reader to guess what the contract was.
