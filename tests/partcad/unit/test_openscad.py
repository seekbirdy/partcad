# The macOS installer. Homebrew disabled the "openscad" cask on 2026-09-01 for

# the same command, could not either. None of that is visible from a Linux test
# run, and the command is a list of strings nothing here executes, so the cask
# it names is pinned rather than left to be rediscovered the next time the one

    Homebrew download directory, which is not something a unit test may do to

    Homebrew is there before reaching for it -- and the machines this suite runs
