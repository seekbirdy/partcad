    object of that flavour is an opt-in by a caller who already has the library.
    Here it means the test runs only where somebody has installed one.

    'pytest.importorskip' is not enough to say that. It turns a *missing module*
    into a skip and lets every other ImportError through, and "cadquery is not
    usable here" is one of those others: cadquery imports 'IVtkOCC_Shape' and
    'IVtkVTK_ShapeData' at module scope, and those exist only in the VTK-carrying
    'cadquery-ocp'. Where OCP is the 'cadquery-ocp-novtk' that build123d depends
    on -- which is the one 'pyproject.toml' names, and the only one a checkout is
    supposed to have -- the novtk package's '__init__' leaves them undefined and
    "import cadquery" dies on "cannot import name 'IVtkOCC_Shape'". That is this
    machine not having a library, not this library being broken, so it skips.
