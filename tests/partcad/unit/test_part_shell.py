"""End to end: what reaches the core when a script hands back a shell.

A shell is a skin - faces joined along their edges, with nothing said about
which side of them is material - and a part that is one renders and measures
correctly while every boolean against it comes back with no solid in it. The
wrappers therefore state a *closed* shell as the solid it already bounds
('wrappers/wrapper_common.solidify'), and an open one is left alone because
there is no solid it bounds.

These run the real thing: a script in a sandbox, through the wrapper, into the
BREP envelope the core carries. The verdict is read with 'partcad.brep_inspect',
which is the core's own answer and needs no CAD kernel; OCCT is asked for the
volume as well, so that "it became a solid" is not the only thing checked.

The package declares no requirements of its own, so it renders in the CAD
sandbox the other part tests provision rather than building one.
