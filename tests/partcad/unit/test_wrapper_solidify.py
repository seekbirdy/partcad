"""A part handed back as a closed shell is the solid it bounds.

The wrapper side of the shell story: 'wrapper_common.solidify' states a closed
shell as the solid it already is, so that a cadquery or build123d script that
returns 'Shell' - or a partType that meshes triangles - produces the part it
meant rather than a skin nothing can compute with.

The verdicts are read back with 'partcad.brep_inspect', which is the core-side
half of the same story and needs no CAD kernel of its own; asking OCCT for the
volume as well is what makes it a test of the geometry rather than of the two
implementations agreeing with each other.
