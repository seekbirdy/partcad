"""Covers what an import is allowed to download from a repository with many branches.

A depth limit alone does not bound a clone: the default refspec is a wildcard,
so every branch still arrives, each with a complete snapshot of its tree. git
calls the cure --single-branch; here it is the refspec the remote is created
with, so these tests check the refspecs rather than the flags.

Served over HTTP because libgit2 refuses a shallow request on the local
transport, and a shallow clone is what makes the wildcard expensive.
