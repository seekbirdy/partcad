"""The third sandbox mechanism: a container an implementation declares.

A Python sandbox can only bring what pip can install. Some implementations need
more -- a native solver, a mesher with no wheel for this platform, a whole
third-party application -- and the point of letting them declare a container is
that such a plugin becomes responsible for its own dependencies instead of
asking every user to install them.

Nothing here starts a container. What is checked is the part that decides *what*
would be started and what would be sent to it, plus the one absence that is
allowed to excuse a check: no container runtime at all.
