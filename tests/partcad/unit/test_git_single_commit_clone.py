"""Covers cloning a commit id against a real server.

The interesting behaviour belongs to the server, not the client: whether it
will serve a commit id by name at all. Under protocol v2, the default since git
2.26, a reachable commit is served regardless of
uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant. A server still speaking v0 applies that
setting and refuses. Both answers have to work, so these tests run against a
real smart-HTTP server where the refusal is genuine rather than simulated.

A local path cannot be used for this: it serves the commit either way, so the
fallback would never be reached and the test would pass without testing it. It
could not be shallow either, which libgit2 refuses on the local transport.
