"""The sandbox's answer, and everything else that wants the same descriptor.

A wrapper answers PartCAD on its standard output, so anything else printing
there corrupts the answer. That is not hypothetical: OCCT's STEP writer prints a
transfer summary on every `Write()`, gmsh prints unless told twice not to, and
`custom_cqgi.py` prints its own diagnostics -- and a native library writes to
file descriptor 1 directly, where neither `contextlib.redirect_stdout` nor
reassigning `sys.stdout` can reach it.

So `wrapper_common` takes the descriptor away and keeps the real one for
`handle_output()`. These run a wrapper as a real subprocess, because that is the
only way to have something write to descriptor 1 the way a shared library does.
