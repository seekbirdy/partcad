"""'pc add' given a URL pins what it fetched.

An object added from a URL is not reproducible unless the declaration says which
bytes to expect, and asking the author to go and compute a digest by hand would
be asking them to do what the machine has just done: adding the object fetches
the file once, so the hash is there for the taking. It is written in, and the
author is left with an object that is pinned from the moment it exists.
