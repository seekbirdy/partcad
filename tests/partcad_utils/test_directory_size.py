"""Tests for `directory_size`, the walk behind both status reports.

What it walks is PartCAD's internal state directory, which other processes are
writing to while it walks: conda sandboxes being built and torn down, git clones
being replaced. So the case that matters here is not the arithmetic -- it is a
name that `os.walk` listed and that is gone by the time the size is asked for.
That raised out of the walk and took the whole report with it, which is how
`pc system status` came back without its "Total internal data storage size:"
line on a CI machine that was provisioning a sandbox at the same time.
