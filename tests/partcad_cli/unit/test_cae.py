"""Tests for `pc cae fea` and `pc cae cfd`.

Both commands are `analysis_command()` with a different word, which is the whole
point of them sharing it: a user who has learned one has learned the other. What
is pinned here is the wrapping rather than the analysis -- what reaches the
daemon, and the two things this process does with what comes back.

The exit status is the part worth being careful about. A finding is what the user
asked about, so a run that produced one is a run whose answer is "no", and
`pc cae fea && ...` has to stop there. A run that found nothing is a pass and
exits zero, the same way `pc test` does. Nothing here starts a solver: the daemon
call is replaced, because which request is sent is the contract and what a solver
would do with it is not this command's business.
