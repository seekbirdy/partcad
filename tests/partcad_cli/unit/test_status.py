"""`pc system status` and `pc daemon status`, through the real CLI.

Written at the same level as test_version.py: invoke the command a user would
type and assert what they would read. Nothing is stubbed, so `pc daemon status`
exercises the whole path -- CLI, client, socket, daemon session, operation --
the way it does in the field.

The behave suite covers the rest of the command surface end to end; these two
are here because status is the report a user reaches for first when something
looks wrong, on either side of the daemon boundary.
