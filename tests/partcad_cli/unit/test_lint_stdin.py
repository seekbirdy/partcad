"""What `pc lint --file --stdin` reads.

The buffer on standard input comes from an editor: the VS Code extension writes
the document as UTF-8 and reads this command's JSON back the same way. Python
does not agree with that on its own -- ``sys.stdin`` decodes with the locale
encoding, which is UTF-8 on Linux and macOS and the ANSI code page on Windows --
so a file with a non-ASCII character in it was checked as mojibake there, or
died in the decoder and took the findings with it. Nothing about that is visible
from a POSIX runner, which is why the encoding is pinned rather than inherited,
and why these tests hand the reader a stream that is *not* UTF-8.
