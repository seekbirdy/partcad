"""`pc daemon start` and `pc daemon stop`, on every platform.

Both commands used to answer Windows with a sentence instead of doing anything
-- `daemon start` printing "not available on Windows yet" on *stdout*, where the
endpoint goes, with a zero exit status. The VS Code extension reads that stdout
to find the daemon, so it connected to the sentence and the window was left with
no PartCAD in it at all.

The daemon exists on Windows (a named pipe, served by
`partcad_service_json_rpc.daemon`), so there is nothing here to branch on any
more. These tests hold that: whatever `os.name` says, the command hands the
question to `partcad_client` and prints what came back.
