"""`--help` has to render for every command in the tree.

Commands are loaded lazily: `partcad_cli.click.loader.Loader.get_command`
imports `partcad_cli.click.commands.<path>` the first time click asks for it. So
a command module that cannot be imported is invisible until someone types the
command -- or types `--help` on its *group*, because rich-click renders a group's
command panel by asking for every subcommand in it.

`commands/search/all.py` shipped annotating its parameter with a `CliContext` it
never imported. Python evaluates that annotation at `def` time, so the module
raised `NameError` on import: `pc search all` was unusable and `pc search --help`
died with it. It reached the user as a raw traceback rather than a click error,
because `get_command` only converts `ModuleNotFoundError` and `SyntaxError`.

Nothing caught it. `features/pc.feature` renders `pc --help`, which loads the
top-level commands only, and the behave suite exercised every `pc search`
subcommand except `all`.

The walk below renders help for all of them -- 70-odd nodes, four levels deep --
in about a second, since help is what click produces without running anything.
It deliberately does not go through `CliRunner`: invoking the root callback
writes the parsed global options onto the process-wide `user_config` singleton
(see `clean_user_config` in `test_upgrade.py`), and this test has no business
leaving that behind. Building the context directly renders the same help.

This is the general form of `features/search/all.feature`, which covers the one
command that broke.
