"""The repository releases everything under one version. This checks it.

`pc upgrade` asks `partcad_client.__version__` what is installed and compares it
against the newest release. A version constant that stopped moving is therefore
not cosmetic: it makes the CLI either never upgrade or upgrade forever. Two of
them had stopped moving -- `partcad-utils` and `partcad-service-json-rpc` were
added to the monorepo without being added to `dev-tools/bumpversion.toml` -- and
nothing noticed, because nothing read them.

Most of what this file guarded against went with the packaging. There used to be
five distributions pinning each other at `==`, so a stale pin meant an
unsatisfiable install; there is one now, and within it a pin is an import. What
remains is the per-package `__version__` constants -- still six of them, because
six packages still report a version at runtime -- and the places outside Python
that state the release.

It reads `bumpversion.toml` rather than hardcoding a list, so a package added
later is covered the moment it is declared there, and is caught if it is not.
