"""Reading the session settings the two kinds of client send.

The same setting arrives spelled differently depending on who is talking. The
daemon's own command line turns a flag into the string ``"true"``, while the VS
Code extension forwards its configuration values with their JSON types intact,
so a boolean setting arrives as a real boolean and an older string-enum setting
as ``"true"``/``"false"``. Both have to mean the same thing, or a setting is
silently ignored for one of the two clients.

The reading is shared with the one ``UserConfig`` applies to the ``PC_*``
environment variables, which is the point: there is one answer, not three.
