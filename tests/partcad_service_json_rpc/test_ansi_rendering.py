"""Rendering the log display on the daemon, for clients that cannot.

The CLI receives structured events and replays them through
`logging_ansi_terminal`, which owns the colours and the multi-line progress
footer. The VS Code extension is TypeScript and cannot host that state machine,
so it printed `LEVEL: message` in one colour and dropped every process/action
marker -- and the alternative was a second implementation of the footer in
another language.

A client asks for `log.mode {"ansi": true}` once, on connecting, and from then
on its log events arrive already drawn. What is covered here is that the drawing
is the CLI's own, that asking turns the structured stream *off* rather than
doubling it, and that one connection's footer cannot reach another's terminal.
