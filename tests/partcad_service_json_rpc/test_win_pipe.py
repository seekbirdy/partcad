"""How the Windows named-pipe daemon is started.

Windows has no `fork`, so the daemon is a *new process* rather than a copy of
this one -- which means the argv that starts it has to be right, and nothing
noticed when it was not. It was not: the frozen bundle is a single executable
that takes the service's own options, and it was being run as
`sys.executable -m partcad_service_json_rpc`, which it rejects. That bundle is
what the editor extension downloads and runs, so on Windows the daemon it asked
for was never there.

CI does run Windows, so these run there as well as on POSIX -- but a spawn that
only Windows can check is a spawn nothing checks on a pull request that fails
earlier, so everything here is behind a stand-in ``Popen``.

The spawn itself is Windows-only (detached process creation flags -- 0 on POSIX,
where they are asked for with `getattr`). What is pinned here is everything
about it that is not: the argv, and the redirection that gives a daemon dying
before it serves somewhere to say so.
