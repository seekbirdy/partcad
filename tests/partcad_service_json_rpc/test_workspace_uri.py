"""Tests for the workspace URL <-> path pair the context protocol rides on.

The CLI turns the workspace directory into a URL (``Path(path).resolve().as_uri()``
in ``partcad_cli.click.service.run``) and the daemon turns that URL back into a
directory (``operations._url_to_path``). Both halves are pure functions, yet the
pair only ever broke on Windows: the CLI used to build ``"file://" +
os.path.abspath(path)``, which makes ``urlparse`` read ``D:`` as the URL
*authority*, so the daemon opened something that was not the workspace at all and
every ``pc -p <dir> render/export`` died with "PartCAD configuration file is not
found". Finding that cost a full Windows CI cycle.

The only platform-dependent piece of the decoder is ``urllib.request.url2pathname``,
which resolves to ``nturl2path``'s implementation on Windows and to plain
``unquote`` on POSIX. These tests substitute that one function, so both
platforms' behavior is asserted on whichever platform runs the suite.
