"""`ensure_daemon`'s Windows branch.

CI does run Windows (`windows-latest` and `windows-2022` in `test.yml`), but
nothing ran *this*: `test_daemon.py` guards itself on `socket.AF_UNIX`, which
CPython does not define on Windows, so the module holding the daemon's tests is
skipped on the one platform this branch is for. The branch shipped importing a
name its own `win_pipe` does not define (`is_pipe_alive`, which lives in
`partcad_utils.win_pipe` with the rest of the rendezvous), so every
`partcad-json-rpc --socket` on Windows died of an ImportError on the branch's
first line, before spawning anything, and all the editor extension could report
was "exited 1".

Hence a module of its own, with no AF_UNIX guard: these run on Windows, where
the branch is real, *and* on POSIX, where `_pretending_to_be_windows` supplies
the only thing missing. Everything Windows-specific is behind a fake, so there
is nothing here that needs a Windows kernel -- which is the point, since a test
only Windows can run is a test that was not protecting this branch before.
