"""What `start_daemon` says when the launcher does not leave a daemon behind.

This is the only place that holds what `partcad-json-rpc` printed on its way
out: it captures both of the child's streams, and whatever it does not put in
the exception is gone. `subprocess.run(check=True)` was putting none of it there
-- a launcher that died on a traceback reached the user as "Command '[...]'
returned non-zero exit status 1", with the traceback captured and discarded, and
that is what the editor extension shows in its output channel.

The launcher here is a real child process rather than a fake `subprocess.run`,
because which of a child's streams survive into the message is exactly the
thing under test.
