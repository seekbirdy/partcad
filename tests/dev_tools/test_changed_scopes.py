"""The CI gate that decides which jobs a change runs.

`.github/actions/changed-scopes` sorts the files a pull request touches into
buckets and turns each CI subject on or off from them, and a pull request or a
merge queue run then *skips* whatever it turned off. So a mistake in it does not
show up as a failure: it shows up as a job that quietly did not run, on the one
change it should have run for.

The property that makes that safe is one line of the action -- a path it has not
been taught falls through to "code", and "code" turns everything on -- so a
mistake can only ever run too much. These check that property directly, against
every top-level entry this repository actually has and against a directory it
does not, and then check the handful of mappings the gate exists for.

The script is extracted from the action and run as-is rather than reimplemented
here. A copy of the rules would be a second thing to keep in step, and it would
agree with itself while disagreeing with CI.
