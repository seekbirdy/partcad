"""Framed, bidirectional JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout.

This is the default transport. The extension talks to it with
``vscode-jsonrpc`` using the same ``Content-Length`` framing the Language Server
Protocol uses. Server-to-client notifications (the event stream) share the
output stream with responses, guarded by a lock so the log-streaming thread and
the dispatch loop never interleave a frame.
