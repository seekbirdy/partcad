"""Threaded JSON-RPC server over an AF_UNIX socket.

This is what the per-workspace daemon serves. Every connection is a bidirectional
JSON-RPC endpoint using the same ``Content-Length`` framing as the stdio channel.
A single shared warm :class:`Session` backs all connections; a lock serializes
dispatch, and while a request is handled the session emitter is bound to the
calling connection's writer, so events (logs, items, stats, prompts) are routed
back to that client only.

``daemon.stop`` and ``log.mode`` are handled at the transport level rather than
by the dispatcher: they are properties of the *connection*, and the dispatcher
only ever sees ``(request, session)`` -- and the session is shared by every
client of this daemon, so a setting stored there would be one client deciding
for all of them.
