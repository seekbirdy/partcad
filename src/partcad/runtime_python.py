# Dependencies are installed one "pip install" invocation at a time, so pip
# never sees the constraints of the whole environment at once and cannot detect
# a conflict between them. That matters most for OCP: loading two OCP builds
# into one interpreter crashes the wrapper process with no Python traceback and
# no stderr at all. These constraints are passed to every "pip install" so the
# bound holds regardless of the order the factories install things in.
#
# Since 7.9 both 'cadquery-ocp' (what cadquery depends on) and
# 'cadquery-ocp-novtk' (what build123d 0.11 depends on) declare
# 'cadquery-ocp-proxy' at the exact same version, so bounding the proxy is what
# keeps a single OCP generation in the sandbox -- capping only 'cadquery-ocp'
# would leave the novtk edge free to pull a different one.
#
# Note this does NOT decide which of the two builds wins: they ship the same
# native module and overwrite each other. That is handled by install ordering,
# see sandbox_versions.GUARD_INVALIDATED_BY.
#
# ocpsvg is bounded for the same reason: it depends on the proxy directly and
# build123d's own bound on it is wide.
#
# The numba entry is a different problem that lands in the same file: a platform
# gap, the one sandbox_versions.NLOPT documents, one layer further down and with
# the opposite failure mode. 'cadquery' 2.8 depends on numba, numba depends on
# llvmlite, and the two dropped macOS x86_64 wheels in lockstep -- numba 0.62.1
# and llvmlite 0.45.1 are the last releases that publish one (cp310 through
# cp313), and from numba 0.63.0 / llvmlite 0.46.0 there are none at all.
#
# Unlike nlopt, both still publish an sdist. So pip does not run out of
# candidates and fall back to an older release; it takes the newest and tries to
# *build* it, and building llvmlite needs an LLVM the runner does not have:
# "CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:21 (find_package): Could not find a package
# configuration file provided by 'LLVM'", which fails the whole
# "pip install cadquery==2.8.0" and leaves the sandbox with no CAD stack. A bare
# version range cannot fix that the way NLOPT's does -- the bound has to be one
# pip applies on Intel macOS and nowhere else, which is what the marker is for.
#
# Capping numba alone is enough: numba 0.62.1 declares 'llvmlite<0.46', so the
# llvmlite installed beside it is 0.45.1 by construction. Its other bound,
# 'numpy<2.4', still intersects sandbox_versions.NUMPY ('numpy>=2.2,<3').
#
# Every other platform is left entirely unconstrained, which is the point of the
# marker: the resolve on Linux, Windows and Apple silicon is unchanged.
#
# The residual gap NLOPT describes applies here too: Intel macOS wheels stop at
# cp313, so a 3.14 sandbox on that platform still finds nothing to install.
