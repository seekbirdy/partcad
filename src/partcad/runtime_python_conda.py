# Conda/mamba failures that are the machine, not the request, and that a retry

#
# "Unexpected error N on netlink descriptor M" is not conda's own message at
# all: it is glibc's, from check_pf.c, where getaddrinfo() enumerates local
# interfaces over a NETLINK_ROUTE socket. When that socket answers with an
# unexpected errno (9 is EBADF), glibc calls __libc_fatal() and kills the
# process outright -- so conda dies mid-solve, through no fault of its own or
# ours, and leaves no prefix behind. It is a property of the runner's network
# namespace and it comes and goes; the retry below is the whole remedy.
