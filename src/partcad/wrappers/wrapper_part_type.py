"""Sandbox entry point for a 'wrapper'-kind partType.

A partType of kind 'wrapper' is a package-supplied Python script that builds a
part. This meta-wrapper runs inside the PartCAD sandbox (so it may import OCP /
build123d), executes that script with 'runpy', and serializes the shape(s) it
produces back to PartFactoryWrapper.

The partType script is executed with these globals available:

    request  -- the part's config/parameters (see PartFactoryWrapper)

and is expected to leave its result in a global 'output':

    output = {"shape": <TopoDS_Shape>}                # a single shape, or
    output = {"shapes": [<TopoDS_Shape>, ...]}        # several, or
    output = {"exception": "<message>"}               # a failure

Both '__file__' and the run name '__partcad_part__' are set on the script, so it
can gate its build logic (``if __name__ == "__partcad_part__":``) and remain
importable for its own unit tests.

A shape handed back as a *closed shell* is stated as the solid it already bounds
before it is serialized (see wrapper_common.solidify). A partType that meshes
triangles naturally builds a shell, and a shell is a skin: nothing downstream of
a boolean works on one. So a partType need not know to declare the solid itself,
and one that already does is unaffected.
