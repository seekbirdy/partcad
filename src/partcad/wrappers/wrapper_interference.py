# This script is executed within a python runtime environment to find the pairs
# of parts in an assembly whose solids share space. The core has no CAD library,
# so the only place this can be answered is a runtime that has one.
#
# Bounding boxes are not enough to answer it. Two boxes overlapping says very
# little - a bracket around a shaft, an L around a corner, anything rotated -
# so boxes are used here only to pick the pairs worth asking about, and the
# answer itself comes from a boolean common and the volume of what it produces.

    It is not a formality. A shape whose faces are inconsistently oriented is
    inside out, which OCCT reports as a negative volume, and a boolean common
    against it returns a number with no relation to any shared space: two LDraw
    bricks meshed from triangles and placed 100 mm apart came back sharing
    2282 mm^3. Reporting that as interference would be worse than not checking
    at all, so a shape whose volume is not positive is left out and counted.

    The test is the volume's sign and not BRepCheck_Analyzer, deliberately.
    Plenty of usable geometry is not a valid solid in OCCT's sense and
    intersects perfectly well regardless: an LDraw brick is an open mesh - a
    stud is a cylinder and a top disc with no bottom, resting on a face the
    parent never cuts - so it has hundreds of free boundary edges and fails
    IsValid, while two copies of it 100 mm apart correctly share nothing.
    Gating on validity would refuse to check any assembly built from such
    parts, forever, which is most of what this test exists for.
