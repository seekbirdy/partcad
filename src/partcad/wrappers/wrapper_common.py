    A wrapper answers PartCAD on its standard output, so anything else that

    OCCT's STEP writer prints a transfer summary on every 'Write()'; gmsh prints
    unless told twice not to; a script's own 'print()' lands there, as do the
    diagnostics in 'custom_cqgi.py' beside this file. A native library's output
    goes to file descriptor 1 directly, so 'contextlib.redirect_stdout' does not
    catch it and neither does reassigning 'sys.stdout' -- the only thing that
    does is taking the descriptor away.

    So descriptor 1 is pointed at standard error and the real one is kept here
    for 'handle_output()'. Everything that prints keeps working and its output
    lands in the log, where it is useful; the one thing that changes is that it
    can no longer be mistaken for part of the response.

def solidify(shape):
    """Replace every closed shell in 'shape' with the solid it already bounds.

    A shell is a skin: faces joined along their edges, with nothing said about
    which side of them is material. A solid is a shell that has been declared to
    bound a volume, and the declaration is the whole difference. It changes
    nothing about how the shape looks and everything about what can be computed
    from it: two 10 mm cubes overlapping by 5 mm share 500 mm^3 and add up to
    1500, and asking OCCT for either against the second one's *shell* returns a
    result with no solid in it and a volume of zero. So a part handed back as a
    shell builds, renders, exports and measures its right size while being
    useless for interference, CAM, FEA or a bill of materials, and nothing about
    it looks wrong.

    Which is worth fixing here rather than reporting, because a *closed* shell
    and the solid it bounds are the same geometry: the solid states what the
    shell already is. So a script that hands back 'Shell' instead of 'Solid' -
    which cadquery and build123d both let it do, as does a partType wrapper
    meshing triangles - produces the part that was meant.

    A shell that is **not** closed is left alone. There is no solid it bounds,
    and declaring one anyway would replace a shape that is honestly a surface
    with a solid OCCT reports as invalid and computes nonsense from - a worse
    thing than the shell, and a silent one. Such a shape reaches the core as a
    shell, which is what 'partcad.brep_inspect' looks for and the 'shell' check
    reports.

    A compound is descended into and rebuilt with the shells in it converted,
    which is the case that matters most in practice: both wrappers compound
    whatever a script returns, so a shell usually arrives inside one rather than
    on its own. Solids are left as they are, boundary shell included - a solid's
    shell is not a free shell, and rebuilding it would be the one way to break a
    shape this is supposed to leave alone.

    Returns the argument itself when nothing changed, so a part with no shell in
    it serializes to exactly the bytes it did before: rebuilding a compound bakes
    the parent's location into its children, and a shape nobody asked about must
    not move.

    'BRepCheck_Shell.Closed()' asks the geometry rather than reading the shell's
    'Closed' flag: the flag is set by the algorithms that happen to know, so a
    shell that came out of sewing or out of a mesher can be closed with the flag
    unset, and trusting it would leave exactly the shapes this is for as shells.

    The solid is oriented after it is built. A closed shell whose faces point
    inward bounds the space *outside* it, and the solid made from it measures a
    negative volume - the failure 'partcad.test.solidity' exists to report. So
    converting without orienting would turn a shell nothing computed from into a
    solid everything computes from wrongly; 'BRepLib.OrientClosedSolid_s'
    reverses it when needed and is what makes this conversion safe.

    Which is why its answer is read rather than assumed. It returns False for a
    solid it cannot orient - "open or incoherent" - and a shell can reach it in
    that state: 'BRepCheck_Shell.Closed()' asks whether the faces leave a free
    edge, not whether their orientations agree with each other, so a shell whose
    faces are coherently joined and inconsistently turned passes the check above
    and cannot be oriented here. The shell is then kept as it is, which is the
    same answer an unclosed one gets and for the same reason: the solid that
    would be returned is exactly the one this is written to avoid making.

        wraps such geometry is descended into rather than dropped: cadquery and
