"""A JavaScript sandbox that runs the Node.js already installed on the host.

The twin of runtime_python_none: no interpreter is provisioned, only the
dependency tree is. What the package asked for is therefore a request rather
than a guarantee - so this runtime is identified by the Node.js it actually
found, not by the one it was asked for.

That distinction matters because the version is what names the sandbox
directory and what a shape is cached under (see
Shape.set_environment_cache_key). Taking the request at face value would let a
package that asks for Node.js 24 run on the host's 22 and then record the result
as though 24 had produced it. Use the conda sandbox when a version has to be
enforced rather than observed.
