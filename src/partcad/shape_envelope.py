"""Pure-Python codec for the shape wire/cache envelope - no OCP, no live shapes.

The core process standardizes on carrying shapes as BREP bytes wrapped in a
small JSON envelope, and never as live OCP objects. This module implements that
envelope without importing OCP, so it is what the core (shape.py, cache_shape.py,
transform.py and the delegating factories) uses to (de)serialize.

The envelope is the same one 'wrappers/ocp_serialize.py' produces and consumes,
so the two are wire-compatible. The difference is deliberate and is the whole
point of the split:

  * The sandbox codec (ocp_serialize) turns a shape object back into a live
    'TopoDS_Shape' on 'decode' - wrappers need the real geometry.
  * This core codec leaves a shape object as its '{"name", "label", "brep"}'
    dict on 'decode' - the core only ever moves the bytes around.

A single shape is '{"name", "label", "brep"}'; an assembly is
'{"name", "label", "assembly": [...]}'. Either may also carry an optional
"location" and an optional "properties" (see the keys below).
Requests/responses are ordinary JSON objects that carry such shape objects
under keys like "shape" or "wrapped".

The "brep" payload is zstd-compressed BREP. Which Python type holds it depends
on the layer, and that is the whole reason this module exists:

  * In memory, in the file cache and in every remote cache it is 'bytes' - the
    compressed frame itself. Nothing there needs it to be text, and base64
    would cost a third more space and a copy in each direction.
  * On the wrapper pipe it is a base64 'str', because that hop is JSON and JSON
    has no byte type. 'encode()' puts it into that form and 'decode()' takes it
    straight back out, so the boundary is these two functions and nowhere else.

# How far a BREP payload may expand before 'brep_plain()' refuses to finish
# decompressing it, as a multiple of the compressed size and never less than the
# floor. Both come from measurement rather than from taste: across the shapes
# the example packages build, BREP compresses by a median of 4.3x and at worst
# by 17.4x, while a zstd frame of 6 KB expands to 200 MB - a ratio of 32,000 -
# and costs nothing to write. The gap between the two is wide enough that a
# limit set in the middle of it cannot be reached by geometry.
#
# It is a ratio rather than a size so that it scales with the part instead of
# guessing how large a part may be, and the floor is there so that a payload of
# a few hundred bytes is not held to a few tens of thousands.
#
# What it defends: this is the one place the *core* process decompresses a shape.
# Everywhere else the payload is moved around unopened, and the one process that
# does open it - a sandbox running a wrapper - is a subprocess whose death costs
# one shape. The core is a daemon that may be serving several workspaces, and
# what it decompresses here comes out of a shape cache, which on a shared
# 'memcache' or 's3' backend is not necessarily something this machine wrote.
