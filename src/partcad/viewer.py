"""Send shapes to the PartCAD IDE viewer.

'Shape.show()' and 'Interface.show()' both end here. The work splits in two:

  * Tessellation runs in a sandbox (wrapper_show.py). The core carries shapes as
    BREP envelopes and never holds a live OCP object, so it cannot tessellate;
    and the receiving end is a browser, which cannot either. What crosses the
    socket is therefore compressed binary glTF.

  * Delivery runs through 'partcad_ide_client', imported lazily right here.
    That package ships inside this distribution - its source is the
    'partcad-ide-client' component, symlinked in at 'src' - so
    'pip install partcad' is enough and nothing installs it separately; the
    import is still lazy because it is only ever needed when something is being
    shown, and still guarded because a partial or corrupted install should
    degrade a preview to a warning rather than fail the command that asked for
    it.

This replaces handing live OCP objects to 'ocp_vscode', which required a full
CAD stack in-process (and a second, differently-provisioned one in the IDE's
interpreter) purely to draw a picture.
