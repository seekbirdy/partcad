        The counterpart of 'get_mcftt()' for the parameters a type contributes
        rather than the object invents. It reads the same place - the object's
        own 'parameters:' - and differs in what happens when nothing is
        declared: the default comes from the type that produces the shape, not
        from here.

        The default is applied *here*, on the way out, and is deliberately never
        written into 'config["parameters"]'. 'Shape.__init__' hashes that
        dictionary into the shape's cache key, so injecting a default would move
        the key of every homogeneous part that never mentioned a tolerance - a
        mass invalidation of existing cache entries for a value nobody set. Read
        this way, an undeclared tolerance stays out of the hash entirely, while a
        tolerance somebody did declare keys the cache like any other input,
        because it is one.

        The default doubles as the parameter's type witness: a numeric default
        means the parameter is numeric, so a declared value is coerced to a
        number. A value that will not coerce is reported and the default is used
        instead, which is how 'PartConfigManufacturing' treats a manufacturing
        method it does not recognize.

        Reads 'self.config' rather than the resolved final configuration, the
        same as 'get_mcftt()' does, so an alias reports what the alias itself
        declares. That is a pre-existing property of both readers, not something
        decided here.
