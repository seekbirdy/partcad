"""A sandbox that is a real virtual environment of its own.

The middle ground between the two sandboxes that existed before it, and the
reason it is the fallback rather than either of them:

  * 'conda' provisions the interpreter as well as the packages, so it can give a
    package the Python version it asked for. It has to be installed first, and
    on a host without it there was nothing to fall back to but:
  * 'none', which is not an environment at all. It runs whatever Python the host
    has and installs into it -- so rendering a part writes packages into the
    interpreter the user runs everything else with, and a machine whose Python
    is not writable (a system package manager's, a read-only image) cannot
    render at all.

This one creates a virtual environment at the sandbox's own path and both
installs into it and runs from it, which is what a sandbox is for. It cannot
choose an interpreter version -- a venv is made *from* an interpreter, so what
the host has is what a package gets -- and it says so when the host's version is
not the one asked for, rather than quietly rendering on the wrong one.
