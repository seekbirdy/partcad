    PartCAD guards each cached git repository with a file lock so that two
    processes never clone the same repository into the same directory at once.
    The operating system releases the lock when the process exits, but the lock
    file itself is left on disk. A lock file that no process holds is therefore
    only clutter; this check finds those and offers to remove them. A lock a
    running process still holds is left untouched.
