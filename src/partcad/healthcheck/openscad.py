"""OpenSCAD: where PartCAD finds the executable, and the check that reports it.

The resolution helpers below (``find_executable`` and friends) are the single
place that decides which OpenSCAD PartCAD runs. The standalone bundle carries
its own OpenSCAD and that copy is preferred over anything installed on the host,
so the bundle behaves the same on every machine rather than depending on
whatever version a host happens to have; everywhere else -- the wheels, a source
checkout -- there is no bundled copy and this falls back to the host's, exactly
as before. Every bundle carries OpenSCAD except the Linux arm64 one, which has
none to carry: upstream builds no current arm64 snapshot. Every bundle that does
carry one carries the same version, so a ``.scad`` part renders the same
wherever ``pc`` runs; see ``dev-tools/pyinstaller/build.sh`` for why that shared
version is a development snapshot rather than a release, and for the expiry that
comes with it.
