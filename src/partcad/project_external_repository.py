    """A package whose contents are served by an external repository plugin.

    Every remote interaction is funneled through 'request()', which memoizes a
    single external call by an arbitrary key. Caching one request at a time -
    rather than a whole 'list' or a whole 'get' - keeps entries small and
    composable: a paged listing becomes several keyed entries, and many
    single-object fetches can share the enumeration entry instead of each
    producing its own. All access to the backing plugin goes through 'request()'.

    Data is addressed as key/value pairs so that new metadata or new kinds of
    objects can be introduced without changing this class:

        objects/<kind>              -> {name: config, ...}   (enumeration)
        objects/<kind>/<name>       -> config                (single fetch)

        meta                        -> package-level metadata

    A package's metadata may carry 'objectKinds' to say which kinds it holds at
    all; the kinds it leaves out are then never asked for. See
    '_served_kinds()'.

    'get_data(key)' is the single method a repository plugin must implement; the
    accessors below are expressed entirely in terms of it.
