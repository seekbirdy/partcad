"""Check that a package's software says which file it is.

Every software object is a file, and there are two ways a package can be
specific about *which* file:

  * The package carries it. The file is content of the repository, so the
    revision of the package identifies it exactly - which is what a bill of
    materials records beside every software line item.
  * The package pulls it in ('fileFrom'). Nothing about the package identifies
    the file then: the URL serves whatever it serves at the moment it is
    fetched, and the same package revision can produce a different image
    tomorrow. Only a 'fileHash' closes that, so one is required.

That is the whole rule: **in the repository, or pinned**. A firmware image is
the one part of a product that can be swapped without leaving a trace in the
geometry, so a digital thread that cannot say which one went in is not a thread
at all.

The rule itself is 'file_factory.unreproducible_reason()', which the
manufacturing test applies to the file a part is built from as well. What this
check adds is *when* it is answered: at lint time, on the declaration, before
anything has been built or fetched.
