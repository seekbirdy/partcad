    """Check the YAML documents of a package against the schemas that govern them.

    A `partcad.yaml` and an `.assy` are the same kind of document -- a Jinja2
    template that renders to YAML and then has to match a schema -- so they are
    checked by the same code, `partcad_utils.assy_lint.validate_source`, which
    masks the template before parsing and reports each finding at the source
    line and column it came from. What the two subclasses below differ in is
    only which files they walk and which schema each file gets.

    That sharing is the point rather than a convenience. `validate_source` is
    also what every client runs over the single file somebody is editing
    (`partcad_client.lint`, reached by `pc lint --file`), so a finding reads the
    same, at the same position, in the editor and in CI. A second implementation
    here -- handing the raw file to `yaml.safe_load` and reporting whatever
    `jsonschema` raised first -- is what that used to be, and it disagreed with
    the editor twice over: it stopped at one finding per file, and it called a
    templated `partcad.yaml` broken YAML.
