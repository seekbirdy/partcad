"""Common base for parts produced by a script running in a Node.js sandbox.

The JavaScript twin of part_factory_python: it resolves which Node.js sandbox
the part renders in and what goes into it, then hands the script to a wrapper
running there.

The dependency set is settled here, when the factory is constructed, rather than
when the part is rendered. Both the directory the part renders in and the cache
key its shape is stored under are derived from that set, so it must not still be
moving once a render starts.
