"""Sandboxed Node.js environments, the JavaScript twin of runtime_python.

The shape of this module deliberately mirrors 'runtime_python': a runtime is a
Node.js of a given major version, packages are installed into it behind guard
files, a *session* collects the dependencies one PartCAD package needs, and the
whole thing is serialized by a runtime lock plus a per-environment file lock so
that concurrent PartCAD processes cannot install over each other.

What differs is the directory layout, because npm resolves dependencies from the
filesystem rather than from a path list. Three levels:

  <sandbox>/pc-js-<sandbox type>-<node major>/     the runtime
    env/                                           the baseline environment
      package.json                                 the manifest, carrying the npm overrides
      node_modules/                                what every sandbox gets by default
      .partcad.installed.<hash>                    install guards
      pkg-<package hash>/                          one working directory per PartCAD package
        node_modules -> ../node_modules            symlink, so cwd-based resolution works
        package.json -> ../package.json            symlink, so cwd-based detection works
    v-env-<dependency set hash>/                   an environment for one set of dependencies
      ... same contents as env/ ...

The middle level is the v-env twin: an npm dependency tree identified by the
*set of dependencies* it provides, so two PartCAD packages that declare the same
dependencies share one tree and a package that adds a dependency gets its own.
Nothing ever mutates a tree another package is depending on, which is what makes
it safe to share.

The third level exists because Node.js and npm both decide what to resolve from
the current working directory. Giving each PartCAD package its own directory
inside the environment - with the environment's 'node_modules' and
'package.json' symlinked in - means every run finds the right dependency tree
while whatever a run writes relative to that directory stays its own.

Containerized execution is inherited rather than reimplemented, exactly as
runtime_python inherits it: 'runtime.Runtime' owns 'use_docker()' and routes
'run()'/'run_async()' through the JSON-RPC client when one is attached, and the
provisioning path here (install_onced_locked) goes through those base methods
for the same reason the pip installs do. Running a wrapper spawns directly, as
runtime_python.run_onced does. Nothing in this module is docker-aware on its
own, and nothing should become so.
