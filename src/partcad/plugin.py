# Which command is running. A plugin that blows its deadline is not asked again
# (see Plugin.deadline_is_current), and this is what bounds that: the latch is
# stamped with the generation it was set in, and goes stale as soon as the next
# command begins.
#
# The bound is the command rather than the process because the two costs are not
# the same. Within one command the latch is what keeps a runaway script cheap: a
# recursive listing asks a repository plugin once per package per object kind --
# LDraw's 104 categories at three kinds each -- and paying the deadline for
# every one of those is the wedge it exists to prevent. Between commands it buys
# nothing, and it costs a great deal: the daemon keeps its contexts, and so the
# Plugin objects hanging off them, warm indefinitely (see
# partcad_service_json_rpc.core.session), so a latch that outlived its command
# would leave one transient timeout muting a plugin until the daemon was
# restarted -- with nothing in the message to say that is the remedy.
#
# A CLI process runs exactly one command and exits, so nothing there ever has to
# advance this. The daemon serves many, and does advance it -- once per
# JSON-RPC request, in partcad_service_json_rpc.rpc.methods.build_registry().
#
# One generation for the process, rather than one per thread or per asyncio
# context. The HTTP transport dispatches concurrently, so two commands in flight
# at once share the counter and each one's latch can be staled by the other
# starting. That is deliberate: it costs a re-query of a plugin that had already
# timed out -- the behaviour before the latch existed, and bounded by the
# deadline itself -- whereas the per-context alternatives can strand a latch on
# a worker thread that no later command advances, which is the failure this is
# here to remove. Erring towards asking again is the safe direction.
