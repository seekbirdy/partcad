    A repository that has been deleted, made private or renamed answers with an
    authentication challenge rather than an error. The git command line used to
    wait there on a credential prompt that nothing would ever answer, so the
    whole process hung instead of failing. libgit2 asks this callback instead,
    so the same situation ends in an exception as long as this callback never
    tries to reach a terminal, which it does not.

    ssh remotes are the one case worth answering: the git command line reached
    them through ssh, which offers the running agent's keys and the key files
    it keeps by default, so the same is offered here. Each is offered once,
    because libgit2 asks again for every credential a remote refuses and an
    offer that is never withdrawn would loop forever.

    Credentials a remote needs beyond that come from the user configuration
    (``git.auth``), which is why they are configured upfront: this callback may
    be running inside the background daemon or a CI job, where there is nobody
    to ask. When nothing is configured for the host, it says so and names the
    setting instead of failing with a bare authentication error.
