    """An 'enrich' is an alias to a parameterized instance of what it enriches.

    Both halves of that already exist. A package makes an instance of its own
    object with other parameter values whenever one is asked for by name
    ('cube;width=20.0' - see 'Project.get_object'), and an alias makes an object
    available under a name of its own. So an enrich needs no machinery beyond
    working out which instance its 'with' asks for, and being an alias to it.

    That is also what decides where the two objects live, which is what used to
    go wrong here. The instance belongs to the package that declares the object
    it is an instance of, under a name that says which instance it is; this
    object, carrying the enrich's own name, belongs to the package that
    declares the enrich, where its assemblies refer to it as a local part. It
    used to be the instance that was registered in the source package under the
    *enriching* name - which defaults to the source object's own name - so
    enriching an object replaced it.

    Working out the source in the constructor, rather than while instantiating,
    is what makes a chain of enriches and aliases work in any order: what an
    enrich points at is decided by its own declaration and not by who is asking
    for it.
