"""What "pc render --with-ports" and "--with-interfaces" draw on top of a shape.

A port is a coordinate frame and an interface is a named set of them. Neither is
geometry, so neither appears in a rendered projection - which is exactly what
makes them hard to get right: a port ends up a millimetre off, or facing the
wrong way, and the only way to find out used to be to build an assembly and look
at where the parts landed.

These two options put them on the picture instead. This module answers the
question the renderer cannot: *where are they*, in the coordinate system of the
thing being rendered. For a part that is a lookup ('implements:' already placed
every port). For an assembly it is a walk: each child contributes its own ports,
moved by where the assembly put the child, so a connection that went wrong is
visible as two frames that do not meet.

Everything here is plain Python arithmetic on 'geom.Location' plus the shape
envelopes the port sketches already come as, so the core stays free of OCP; the
drawing itself happens in the render implementation ('//builtin/render'), which
is the only side that knows where the camera is.
