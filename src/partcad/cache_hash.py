# The format of what the caches store, mixed into every hash so that a change
# to it moves every entry to a new key instead of letting an old entry be read
# back under the new rules. Nothing is deleted: the stale files stay on disk
# until the cache is cleaned, they are simply never looked up again.
#
# Bump this whenever the bytes behind a cache key change meaning:
#   1: BREP payloads are zstd-compressed before being base64-encoded
#      (see wrappers/ocp_serialize.py).
#   2: the shape cache stores the payload alone - the outer layer (name, label,
#      placement) is stripped on write and wrapped back on read (see
#      cache_shape.py), and a lone shape is stored as raw BREP bytes.
#   3: a shape's key covers its whole configuration bar the keys that only
#      describe it, instead of 'parameters'/'offset'/'scale' alone (see
#      _NON_GEOMETRIC_CONFIG_KEYS in shape.py). Entries written under 2 were
#      keyed on too little - parts that differ only in a key the allow-list did
#      not name shared one - so none of them may be read back.
