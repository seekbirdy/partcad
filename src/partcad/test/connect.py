    The instructions in the 'how' section of a 'connect'/'connectPorts' node are
    resolved leniently: whatever is missing takes a documented default, and
    whatever contradicts itself is reported and replaced with one, so that an
    assembly always builds. That leniency is what this test looks past. It fails
    an assembly whose instructions had to be repaired to be usable - a minimum
    above its maximum, or two interfaces that disagree about their thread - and
    passes one that is sound, including one that says nothing at all and takes
    every default.
