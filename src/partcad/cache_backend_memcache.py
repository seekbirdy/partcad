"""The remote tier of the cache ('cacheRemote'), over the memcached protocol.

This is the tier a team or a CI fleet shares: one memcached server in front of
everybody's local file cache, so that geometry somebody has already built is
fetched rather than rebuilt. The protocol is memcached's own, so anything that
speaks it will do - a real memcached, a compatible proxy, or the mock server the
tests drive (tests/partcad/unit/memcached_server.py).

What travels is the entry as it is stored everywhere else: for a shape, the
zstd-compressed BREP frame. memcached values are opaque bytes, so the payload
goes onto the socket without a copy or an encoding step, which is the whole
reason the compression happens before the cache rather than inside it.

The client library ('aiomcache') is an ordinary dependency of 'partcad'. It was
an optional extra until it stopped being worth the upkeep: 9.9 KiB, no
dependencies of its own, against four files that had to move together and one
more decision at install time. The import below stays lazy all the same, so a
run that never switches this tier on never pays for it.
