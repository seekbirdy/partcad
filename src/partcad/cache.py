    """A hierarchy of storage tiers, addressed as one key-value store.

    Entries are flat names ('<hash>.<key>') holding bytes. A read walks the
    tiers nearest-first and stops at the first one that has the entry; a write
    offers the entry to every tier whose size window accepts it. Which tiers
    exist is the user's configuration - see cache_backend.build().

    Nothing here inspects, converts or copies a payload: what a caller hands in
    is what every tier stores, and a shape payload is the zstd-compressed BREP
    frame the core already holds (see cache_shape.py).
