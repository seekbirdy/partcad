    An assembly takes parameters like anything else - an ASSY file is a
    template, and the values reach it as 'param_<name>' (see
    'AssemblyFactoryAssy.read_assy') - so an assembly can be enriched like
    anything else, and it means the same thing: the assembly of that package,
    assembled with other values.

    See 'PartFactoryEnrich' for why that is the whole of what an enrich has to
    do, and for where each of the two objects involved ends up.
