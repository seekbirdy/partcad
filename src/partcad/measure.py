"""Measure geometry inside a sandbox.

The core process carries shapes as BREP bytes and does not manipulate live OCP
objects, so the OCCT work that a measurement needs happens in
wrapper_measure.py inside a managed Python runtime. This module is the
core-side entry point: it takes the shape as a BREP envelope, runs the wrapper,
and returns plain numbers. Serialization goes through the pure 'shape_envelope'
codec, so this module never touches OCP.
