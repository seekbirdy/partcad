# The on-disk shape cache used to be pickled. That worked only because the
# wrapper protocol installed OCP 'copyreg' handlers as a global side effect -
# without them 'pickle.dumps()' cannot serialize a TopoDS_Shape at all. Now
# that the protocol no longer registers them, the cache stores plain data,
# which also removes an arbitrary code execution path from a cache file.
#
# What it stores is the payload alone - never the envelope's outer layer. A
# lone shape (a part or a sketch, and the bulk of what is cached) is stored as
# the zstd-compressed BREP frame the core already holds in memory: it goes to
# the storage tier byte for byte, with no JSON, no base64 and no re-encoding.
# Anything else (an assembly tree, a list of components) has to be JSON, and
# there each payload it holds is base64 - the one form JSON can carry.
#
# The two are told apart on read by the leading bytes: JSON produced here is
# always an object or an array, while a BREP payload is either a zstd frame or,
# where the peer had no zstd, the ASCII BREP header - the same distinction
# 'wrappers/ocp_serialize.py' already relies on.
