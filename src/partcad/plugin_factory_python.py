    """Await ``run()`` on behalf of ``plugin``, for at most ``timeout`` seconds.

    A plugin script is third-party code doing whatever it likes in a sandbox of
    its own, and PartCAD waited for it with nothing bounding the wait. That is
    fine until a script is slow rather than broken: the LDraw repository plugin
    that ``//pub/universe/lego/ldraw`` is served by enumerates a category by
    fetching every part in it from ldraw.org, one HTTP request per part, and the
    library has 104 categories and some twenty thousand parts. A recursive
    listing of the public index asks it for every one of them, so ``pc list -r
    //pub`` stopped printing anything and never came back.

    Returns ``None`` when the deadline passes, which every caller here already
    treats as "this plugin has no answer", and records the reason on the plugin
    so that it is not asked again for the rest of this command (see
    ``Plugin.deadline_is_current``). The second half matters as much as the first:
    a package tree served by one plugin asks it once per sub-package per object
    kind, so paying the deadline over and over is the same wedge in slower
    motion -- LDraw's 104 categories, three kinds each, at three minutes apiece
    is fifteen hours.

    The deadline is over the *script*, not over the sandbox it runs in.
    Provisioning a Python sandbox means creating a conda environment and
    installing the CAD stack into it, which legitimately takes many minutes on a
    cold machine and is shared by every package that uses it; that is why
    ``run()`` carries the bound down to the interpreter run itself (see
    PythonRuntime.run_async_onced) rather than it being applied out here.
