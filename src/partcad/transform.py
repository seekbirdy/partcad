"""Run geometry transformations (offset, scale, compound) inside a sandbox.

The core process carries shapes as BREP bytes and does not manipulate live OCP
objects. The OCCT/build123d work that 'offset', 'scale' and 'compound' need
therefore happens in wrapper_transform.py inside a managed Python runtime, not
in-process. This module is the core-side entry point: it takes the operand
shape(s) as BREP envelopes, runs the wrapper, and returns the result as a BREP
envelope. Serialization goes through the pure 'shape_envelope' codec, so this
module never touches OCP.
