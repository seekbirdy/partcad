"""Run a CLI command through the PartCAD daemon.

This is the seam the CLI migration turns on: a command's body calls
:func:`run` with a JSON-RPC method + params instead of importing ``partcad`` and
doing the work in-process. ``run`` ensures the workspace daemon, brackets the
call in a client-side telemetry span (reported directly by the CLI now that
``partcad_utils.telemetry`` is cheaply importable — no telemetry crosses the RPC
boundary), streams the operation's forwarded log events into the shared local
renderer, and returns the result.
