"""`pc upgrade` -- bring the PartCAD installation itself up to date.

The host-level counterpart of `pc update`, which refetches the packages a
package imports. This one updates PartCAD: the Python wheels, or the standalone bundle
that carries its own interpreter. The two are deliberately separate commands
because they act on different things -- one on a package, one on the machine --
and a user upgrading their tools should not have their package graph refetched,
nor the other way round.

It runs **in the client process**, which is where it has to run. Upgrading an
installation is a client-side act: it is this machine's copy of PartCAD being
replaced, by the process running from it. A daemon must not do it -- a daemon can
be remote, where "upgrade PartCAD" would mean upgrading somebody else's
installation.

This command owns the daemon handling the upgrade needs, because the upgrader
deliberately has none. **Every** daemon running on this machine executes the files
about to be replaced, so every one of them is asked to stop and waited for -- but
only once a newer version has been found, so a no-op `pc upgrade` never costs
anybody their warm context. Doing that from a client is what makes it simple: one
process, acting on the machine it runs on, rather than daemons trying to police
each other.

Any daemon that outlives the stop is not fatal. The new version is installed
beside the old one, so a survivor keeps serving from intact files -- and the old
bundle is not removed until this command exits, by which time the survivor is the
only thing that could still be reading it.
