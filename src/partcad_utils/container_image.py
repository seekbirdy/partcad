"""The tag PartCAD's own container images are pulled and published under.

A few images belong to PartCAD rather than to a package -- the Python sandbox
base images, and the KiCad sandbox -- and every one of them is addressed by the
release that built it: ``<name>:<release>``, plus the architecture suffix
``docker_image.candidates`` appends where there is one. That is what an
installed PartCAD pulls, and it is what this returns when nothing says
otherwise.

CI needs one other answer. A change to ``tools/containers`` builds images that
are not the release's, and the tests in that same run have to reach *those*
rather than the ones the last release published -- otherwise a Dockerfile fix
cannot be proven and a Dockerfile regression cannot be caught until after it
lands. Such a run builds ``<release>-<branch>-<digest>-<commit>`` and exports
``PC_CONTAINER_IMAGE_TAG``.

Read out of the environment, and that is deliberately the whole of the mechanism
on this side. The alternative -- asking here whether this is CI, on what branch,
and whether that branch is ``devel`` -- would put a build system's facts inside
a library that mostly runs on somebody's laptop, where those questions have no
answers and a wrong one means ``pc open --with kicad`` quietly starting an
unreviewed branch's image. The run that knows the answer decides; this obeys.
Which also makes it one variable to set in a test, rather than a CI environment
to simulate.
